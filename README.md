LoComposition learns efficient rough-terrain locomotion without air-time targets, contact-count objectives, foot-clearance rewards, or a prescribed gait. The training formulation gives each concern one clear role: rewards specify the task, constraints encode operational limits, mechanical-energy minimization provides a gait preference, and exteroceptive perception makes that preference terrain-aware.

## Cross-embodiment transfer without retuning

</p>

The same formulation and training recipe transfer to Spot and ANYmal C without an embodiment-specific hyperparameter search. Action scaling and operational-limit bounds are adjusted due to actuator differences. Disturbance magnitudes and the energy coefficient are simply scaled linearly by mass ratio.

## Why LoComposition

Quadruped locomotion rewards often mix command tracking, actuator limits, smoothness, foot timing, clearance, and terrain handling into one weighted objective. LoComposition separates them:

- **Task specification:** rewards track commanded planar and yaw velocity.
- **Operational limits:** [Constraints as Terminations (CaT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18765) encodes actuator, action-rate, and posture limits.
- **Gait preference:** mechanical-power minimization favors economical motion without naming a contact pattern.
- **Terrain adaptation:** a robot-centric elevation map lets the policy spend energy where obstacles require it.

The result is an energy-efficient trotting gait that emerges during training and increases clearance when the terrain requires it. CaT is the chosen constraint mechanism for our method, and LoComposition is the complete formulation built around it.

## Results at a glance

Against a conventional complex-reward locomotion baseline, LoComposition provides:

- **56% lower Cost of Transport** with comparable rough-terrain progression;
- **96% fewer operational-limit violations** under the same evaluation thresholds;
- **zero-shot deployment on a Unitree Go2**, using an online LiDAR elevation map and no hardware retraining; and
- **no explicit gait-style priors** in the final policy.

## Installation

The setup script creates a Python 3.11 environment, installs the dependencies recorded in `uv.lock`, and checks out the compatible Isaac Lab source. It requires Linux, an NVIDIA GPU with a compatible driver, Git, and roughly 20 GB of free disk space.

```bash
./create-isaac-lab-env-uv.sh locomposition
source ~/mamba_env_data/locomposition/.venv/bin/activate
cd ~/mamba_env_data/locomposition/LoComposition
```

Use `--root PATH` to place the environment somewhere else, or `--repo-source URL_OR_PATH` to install from a fork or local checkout.

One upstream metadata conflict is handled explicitly: Isaac Sim 5.1 pins a FastAPI version that declares Starlette below 0.46, while this Isaac Lab revision requires the security-updated Starlette 0.49.1. LoComposition keeps Isaac Lab's 0.49.1 requirement, matching the validated development environment. The installer accepts only that exact `uv pip check` warning and still fails on any other dependency incompatibility.

### Cluster training

Environment creation also writes two ready-to-review job files beside the virtual environment:

- `train-locomposition.sbatch` runs three 7,500-environment seeds concurrently on one L40S, with eight CPUs.
- `train-locomposition-2080ti.sbatch` runs one seed per 2080 Ti array job, also with eight CPUs.

Authenticate W&B once from the cluster account whose shared home directory is mounted on the compute nodes. You do not need to do this for each env:

```bash
wandb login
sbatch ~/mamba_env_data/locomposition/train-locomposition.sbatch
```

## Quick start

Train the main Go2 policy:

```bash
python scripts/clean_rl/train.py \
  --task=LoComposition-Go2-Rough-Terrain-Joint-State-History-v0 \
  --seed=46 --headless --num_envs=7500
```

Evaluate a checkpoint and record the standard diagnostics:

```bash
python scripts/eval.py \
  --run_dir=/absolute/path/to/training/run \
  --task=LoComposition-Go2-Rough-Terrain-Joint-State-History-Play-v0 \
  --seed=46 --headless
```

Regenerate plots from a saved evaluation:

```bash
python scripts/generate_plots.py \
  --data_file=/absolute/path/to/evaluation/plots/sim_data.npz \
  --output_dir=/absolute/path/to/output/plots
```

## Repository layout

- `exts/locomposition/`: Isaac Lab environments, robot configurations, CaT constraint manager, and CleanRL PPO implementation.
- `scripts/clean_rl/train.py`: training entry point.
- `scripts/eval.py`: checkpoint evaluation, scenario rollouts, and metric collection.
- `scripts/generate_plots.py`: plot regeneration from saved evaluation arrays.
- `sim2real/`: ROS 2 controller, elevation-map processing, launch stack, and traced policies for the Go2.
- `tests/`: naming, setup, ROS, plotting, and metric contracts.

## Sim-to-real deployment

The Go2 stack runs policy inference at 50 Hz and republishes the latest PD target from a 500 Hz low-level loop. A Livox MID-360 and `elevation_mapping_cupy` produce the online elevation map. The LoComposition processing node converts it to the same yaw-aligned 13×11 observation used in simulation. Read the [sim-to-real deployment guide](docs/sim2real.md) before setting up the hardware.
